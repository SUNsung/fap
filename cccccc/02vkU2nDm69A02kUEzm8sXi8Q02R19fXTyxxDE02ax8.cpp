// When a browser wants to relaunch itself, it can't simply fork off a new
// process and exec a new browser from within. That leaves open a window
// during which two browser applications might be running concurrently. If
// that happens, each will wind up with a distinct Dock icon, which is
// especially bad if the user expected the Dock icon to be persistent by
// choosing Keep in Dock from the icon's contextual menu.
//
// relauncher approaches this problem by introducing an intermediate
// process (the 'relauncher') in between the original browser ('parent') and
// replacement browser ('relaunched'). The helper executable is used for the
// relauncher process; because it's an LSUIElement, it doesn't get a Dock
// icon and isn't visible as a running application at all. The parent will
// start a relauncher process, giving it the 'writer' side of a pipe that it
// retains the 'reader' end of. When the relauncher starts up, it will
// establish a kqueue to wait for the parent to exit, and will then write to
// the pipe. The parent, upon reading from the pipe, is free to exit. When the
// relauncher is notified via its kqueue that the parent has exited, it
// proceeds, launching the relaunched process. The handshake to synchronize
// the parent with the relauncher is necessary to avoid races: the relauncher
// needs to be sure that it's monitoring the parent and not some other process
// in light of PID reuse, so the parent must remain alive long enough for the
// relauncher to set up its kqueue.
