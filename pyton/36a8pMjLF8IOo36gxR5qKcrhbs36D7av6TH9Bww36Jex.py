    When starting from the default values (alpha_init = 1.90, lambda_init = 1.),
the bias of the resulting curve is large, and the variance is small.
So, lambda_init should be relatively small (1.e-3) so as to reduce the bias.

    In both examples below, the main result is that the empirical covariance
estimate, as a non-robust one, is highly influenced by the heterogeneous
structure of the observations. Although the robust covariance estimate is
able to focus on the main mode of the data distribution, it sticks to the
assumption that the data should be Gaussian distributed, yielding some biased
estimation of the data structure, but yet accurate to some extent.
The One-Class SVM does not assume any parametric form of the data distribution
and can therefore model the complex shape of the data much better.
