    # This view is called from FlatpageFallbackMiddleware.process_response
# when a 404 is raised, which often means CsrfViewMiddleware.process_view
# has not been called even if CsrfViewMiddleware is installed. So we need
# to use @csrf_protect, in case the template needs {% csrf_token %}.
# However, we can't just wrap this view; if no matching flatpage exists,
# or a redirect is required for authentication, the 404 needs to be returned
# without any CSRF checks. Therefore, we only
# CSRF protect the internal implementation.
