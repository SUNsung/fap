    First, we fix a training set and increase the number of
samples. Then we plot the computation time as function of
the number of samples.

    In both examples below, the main result is that the empirical covariance
estimate, as a non-robust one, is highly influenced by the heterogeneous
structure of the observations. Although the robust covariance estimate is
able to focus on the main mode of the data distribution, it sticks to the
assumption that the data should be Gaussian distributed, yielding some biased
estimation of the data structure, but yet accurate to some extent.
The One-Class SVM does not assume any parametric form of the data distribution
and can therefore model the complex shape of the data much better.
    
    # Create a graph capturing local connectivity. Larger number of neighbors
# will give more homogeneous clusters to the cost of computation
# time. A very large number of neighbors gives more evenly distributed
# cluster sizes, but may not impose the local manifold structure of
# the data

    Evaluate the ability of k-means initializations strategies to make
the algorithm convergence robust as measured by the relative standard
deviation of the inertia of the clustering (i.e. the sum of squared
distances to the nearest cluster center).
