    Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete
linkage are unstable and tend to create a few clusters that grow very
quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior
by considering all the distances between two clusters when merging them (
while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the
shortest distance between clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this
mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more
brittle single linkage. This effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs
(try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with
complete linkage. In particular, having a very small number of neighbors in
the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage,
which is well known to have this percolation instability. '''
