    When should I use this example?
This example is useful when you wish to recognize a large set of known people,
and make a prediction for an unknown person in a feasible computation time.
    
        # Print the location of each face in this image
    top, right, bottom, left = face_location
    print('A face is located at pixel location Top: {}, Left: {}, Bottom: {}, Right: {}'.format(top, left, bottom, right))
    
        # Convert the image from BGR color (which OpenCV uses) to RGB color (which face_recognition uses)
    frame = frame[:, :, ::-1]
    
            if len(encodings) == 0:
            click.echo('WARNING: No faces found in {}. Ignoring file.'.format(file))
        else:
            known_names.append(basename)
            known_face_encodings.append(encodings[0])
    
        def test_partial_face_locations(self):
        img = api.load_image_file(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'test_images', 'obama_partial_face.jpg'))
        detected_faces = api.face_locations(img)
    
        # Let's trace out each facial feature in the image with a line!
    for facial_feature in face_landmarks.keys():
        d.line(face_landmarks[facial_feature], width=5)
