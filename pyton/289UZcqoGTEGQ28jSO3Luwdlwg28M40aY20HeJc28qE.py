    The problem is :
Given two strings A and B. Find the minimum number of operations to string B such that A = B. The permitted operations are removal,  insertion, and substitution.

        @param y: a one dimensional numpy array. 
        The contents of y are the labels for the corresponding X values
    
      3. find centroids and clusters using kmeans function.
  
        centroids, cluster_assignment = kmeans(
            X,

            verbose=True # whether to print logs in console or not.(default=False)
            )
  
  
  4. Plot the loss function, hetrogeneity values for every iteration saved in hetrogeneity list.
        plot_heterogeneity(

  5. Have fun..

    Sentiment analysis can be casted as a binary text classification problem,
that is fitting a linear classifier on features extracted from the text
of the user messages so as to guess wether the opinion of the author is
positive or negative.
