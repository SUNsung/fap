    '''
    Django provides full support for anonymous sessions. The session
    framework lets you store and retrieve arbitrary data on a
    per-site-visitor basis. It stores data on the server side and
    abstracts the sending and receiving of cookies. Cookies contain a
    session ID -- not the data itself.
    
    *What does this example do?
The code shows a way to localize words in two languages: English and
Greek. 'getLocalizer' is the factory method that constructs a
localizer depending on the language chosen. The localizer object will
be an instance from a different class according to the language
localized. However, the main code does not have to worry about which
localizer will be instantiated, since the method 'get' will be called
in the same way independently of the language.
