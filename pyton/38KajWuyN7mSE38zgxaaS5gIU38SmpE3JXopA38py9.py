    and flattening the end structure into a list of lines. Revision 2 maybe ^.^.

    In the second benchmark, we increase the number of dimensions of the
training set, classify a sample and plot the time taken as a function
of the number of dimensions.

    The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate can be regularized
using shrinkage. Ledoit and Wolf proposed a close formula to compute
the asymptotically optimal shrinkage parameter (minimizing a MSE
criterion), yielding the Ledoit-Wolf covariance estimate.
