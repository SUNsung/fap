      3. find centroids and clusters using kmeans function.
  
        centroids, cluster_assignment = kmeans(
            X, 
            k, 
            initial_centroids,

            record_heterogeneity=heterogeneity, 
            verbose=True # whether to print logs in console or not.(default=False)
            )
  
  
  4. Plot the loss function, hetrogeneity values for every iteration saved in hetrogeneity list.
        plot_heterogeneity(
            heterogeneity, 
            k
        )
  
  5. Have fun..

* Wondering how this method works !
* It's pretty simple.
* Let's say you need to calculate a ^ b
* RULE 1 : a ^ b = (a*a) ^ (b/2) ---- example : 4 ^ 4 = (4*4) ^ (4/2) = 16 ^ 2
* RULE 2 : IF b is ODD, then ---- a ^ b = a * (a ^ (b - 1)) :: where (b - 1) is even.
* Once b is even, repeat the process to get a ^ b
* Repeat the process till b = 1 OR b = 0, because a^1 = a AND a^0 = 1
*
* As far as the modulo is concerned,
* the fact : (a*b) % c = ((a%c) * (b%c)) % c
* Now apply RULE 1 OR 2 whichever is required.
