    *What does this example do?
The code shows a way to localize words in two languages: English and
Greek. 'getLocalizer' is the factory method that constructs a
localizer depending on the language chosen. The localizer object will
be an instance from a different class according to the language
localized. However, the main code does not have to worry about which
localizer will be instantiated, since the method 'get' will be called
in the same way independently of the language.
