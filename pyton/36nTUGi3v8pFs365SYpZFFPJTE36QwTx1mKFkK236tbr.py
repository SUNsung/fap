    A Token object like we'd use in ANTLR 2.x; has an actual string created

    tree nodes that have payload objects.  We need to create a Token object
    that has a string; the tree node will point at this token.  CommonToken
    has indexes into a char stream and hence cannot be used to introduce
    new strings.
