        Any state that has a semantic predicate edge is special; those states
    are generated with if-then-else structures in a specialStateTransition()
    which is generated by cyclicDFA template.

            Terence implemented packed table initializers, because Java has a
        size restriction on .class files and the lookup tables can grow
        pretty large. The generated JavaLexer.java of the Java.g example
        would be about 15MB with uncompressed array initializers.
