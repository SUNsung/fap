    Sentiment analysis can be casted as a binary text classification problem,
that is fitting a linear classifier on features extracted from the text
of the user messages so as to guess wether the opinion of the author is
positive or negative.

    We generate data from three groups of waveforms. Two of the waveforms
(waveform 1 and waveform 2) are proportional one to the other. The cosine
distance is invariant to a scaling of the data, as a result, it cannot
distinguish these two waveforms. Thus even with no noise, clustering
using this distance will not separate out waveform 1 and 2.
