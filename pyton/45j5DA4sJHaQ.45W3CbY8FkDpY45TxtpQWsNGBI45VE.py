         ..
         # Not needed to change the device scope for model definition:
         model = Xception(weights=None, ..)
    
        # Arguments
        filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space
            (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
        kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of n integers, specifying the
            dimensions of the convolution window.
        strides: An integer or tuple/list of n integers,
            specifying the strides of the convolution.
            Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying
            any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
        padding: One of `'valid'` or `'same'` (case-insensitive).
        data_format: A string,
            one of `'channels_last'` (default) or `'channels_first'`.
            It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your
            Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`.
            If you never set it, then it will be `'channels_last'`.
        dilation_rate: An integer or tuple/list of n integers, specifying
            the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution.
            Currently, specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1 is
            incompatible with specifying any `strides` value != 1.
        activation: Activation function to use
            (see [activations](../activations.md)).
            If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
            (ie. 'linear' activation: `a(x) = x`).
        recurrent_activation: Activation function to use
            for the recurrent step
            (see [activations](../activations.md)).
        use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
        kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix,
            used for the linear transformation of the inputs.
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        recurrent_initializer: Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel`
            weights matrix,
            used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        unit_forget_bias: Boolean.
            If True, add 1 to the bias of the forget gate at initialization.
            Use in combination with `bias_initializer='zeros'`.
            This is recommended in [Jozefowicz et al. (2015)](
            http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf).
        kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        recurrent_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        recurrent_constraint: Constraint function applied to
            the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
            Fraction of the units to drop for
            the linear transformation of the inputs.
        recurrent_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
            Fraction of the units to drop for
            the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
