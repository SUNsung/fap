    The approach taken is explained below. I decided to do it simply.
    Initially I was considering parsing the data into some sort of
    structure and then generating an appropriate README. I am still
    considering doing it - but for now this should work. The only issue
    I see is that it only sorts the entries at the lowest level, and that
    the order of the top-level contents do not match the order of the actual
    entries.
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
    
                gc.collect()
            print('- benchmarking LassoLars')
            clf = LassoLars(alpha=alpha, fit_intercept=False,
                            normalize=False, precompute=precompute)
            tstart = time()
            clf.fit(X, Y)
            lars_lasso_results.append(time() - tstart)
    
    The input data is mostly low rank but is a fat infinite tail.
