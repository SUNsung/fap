*What is this pattern about?
The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated the
same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of
a composite is to 'compose' objects into tree structures to represent
part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients
treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
