    *What does this example do?
This particular implementation abstracts the creation of a pet and
does so depending on the factory we chose (Dog or Cat, or random_animal)
This works because both Dog/Cat and random_animal respect a common
interface (callable for creation and .speak()).
Now my application can create pets abstractly and decide later,
based on my own criteria, dogs over cats.

*What is this pattern about?
This pattern is used when creating an object is costly (and they are
created frequently) but only a few are used at a time. With a Pool we
can manage those instances we have as of now by caching them. Now it
is possible to skip the costly creation of an object if one is
available in the pool.
A pool allows to 'check out' an inactive object and then to return it.
If none are available the pool creates one to provide without wait.
