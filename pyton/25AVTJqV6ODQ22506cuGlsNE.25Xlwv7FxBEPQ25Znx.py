    A Lexer emits Token objects which are usually buffered by a TokenStream. A
Parser can build a Tree, if the output=AST option has been set in the grammar.

    A tree.RewriteCardinalityException is raised, when the parsers hits a
cardinality mismatch during AST construction. Although this is basically a
bug in your grammar, it can only be detected at runtime.
