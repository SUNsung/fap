        classification accuracy as an equivalent ReLU-based network.

    The VAE has a modular design. The encoder, decoder and VAE
are 3 models that share weights. After training the VAE model,
the encoder can be used to  generate latent vectors.
The decoder can be used to generate MNIST digits by sampling the
latent vector from a Gaussian distribution with mean=0 and std=1.

    The quality of the approximation is measured by the spectral norm discrepancy
between the original input matrix and the reconstructed one (by multiplying
the randomized_svd's outputs). The spectral norm is always equivalent to the
largest singular value of a matrix. (3) justifies this choice. However, one can
notice in these experiments that Frobenius and spectral norms behave
very similarly in a qualitative sense. Therefore, we suggest to run these
benchmarks with `enable_spectral_norm = False`, as Frobenius' is MUCH faster to
compute.
