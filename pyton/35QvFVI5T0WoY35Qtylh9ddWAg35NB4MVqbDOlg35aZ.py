        In both cases (loading from any Python file or loading from modules),
    only uppercase keys are added to the config.  This makes it possible to use
    lowercase values in the config file for temporary values that are not added
    to the config or to define the config keys in the same file that implements
    the application.

        By default it will try to guess the mimetype for you, but you can
    also explicitly provide one.  For extra security you probably want
    to send certain files as attachment (HTML for instance).  The mimetype
    guessing requires a `filename` or an `attachment_filename` to be
    provided.
