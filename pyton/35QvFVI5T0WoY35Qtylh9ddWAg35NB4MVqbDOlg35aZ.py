            Python does not have any size restrictions, but the compilation of
        such large source files seems to be pretty memory hungry. The memory
        consumption of the python process grew to >1.5GB when importing a
        15MB lexer, eating all my swap space and I was to impacient to see,
        if it could finish at all. With packed initializers that are unpacked
        at import time of the lexer module, everything works like a charm.
