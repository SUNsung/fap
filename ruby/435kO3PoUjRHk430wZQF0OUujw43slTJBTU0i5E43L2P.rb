          `grouping` is just to keep your tags organised under one 'folder', defaults to 'builds'
          `lane` is the name of the current fastlane lane
          `prefix` is anything you want to stick in front of the version number, e.g. 'v'
          `postfix` is anything you want to stick at the end of the version number, e.g. '-RC1'
          `build_number` is the build number, which defaults to the value emitted by the `increment_build_number` action
