    # This bin wrapper runs the `pod` command in a OS X sandbox. The reason for this
# is to ensure that people can’t use malicious code from pod specifications.
#
# It does this by creating a ‘seatbelt’ profile on the fly and executing the
# given command through `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`. This profile format is an
# undocumented format, which uses TinyScheme to implement its DSL.
#
# Even though it uses a undocumented format, it’s actually very self-explanatory.
# Because we use a whitelist approach, `(deny default)`, any action that is
# denied is logged to `/var/log/system.log`. So tailing that should provide
# enough information on steps that need to be take to get something to work.
