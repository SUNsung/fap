  # This class handles guest-OS specific interactions with a machine.
  # It is primarily responsible for detecting the proper guest OS
  # implementation and then delegating capabilities.
  #
  # Vagrant has many tasks which require specific guest OS knowledge.
  # These are implemented using a guest/capability system. Various plugins
  # register as 'guests' which determine the underlying OS of the system.
  # Then, 'guest capabilities' register themselves for a specific OS (one
  # or more), and these capabilities are called.
  #
  # Example capabilities might be 'mount_virtualbox_shared_folder' or
  # 'configure_networks'.
  #
  # This system allows for maximum flexibility and pluginability for doing
  # guest OS specific operations.
