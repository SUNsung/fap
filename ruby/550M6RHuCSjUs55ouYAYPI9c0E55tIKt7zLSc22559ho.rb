      # This is the primary entry point of the Importer.
      # It corresponds directly to an `@import` statement in Sass.
      # It should do three basic things:
      #
      # * Determine if the URI is in this importer's format.
      #   If not, return nil.
      # * Determine if the file indicated by the URI actually exists and is readable.
      #   If not, return nil.
      # * Read the file and place the contents in a {Sass::Engine}.
      #   Return that engine.
      #
      # If this importer's format allows for file extensions,
      # it should treat them the same way as the default {Filesystem} importer.
      # If the URI explicitly has a `.sass` or `.scss` filename,
      # the importer should look for that exact file
      # and import it as the syntax indicated.
      # If it doesn't exist, the importer should return nil.
      #
      # If the URI doesn't have either of these extensions,
      # the importer should look for files with the extensions.
      # If no such files exist, it should return nil.
      #
      # The {Sass::Engine} to be returned should be passed `options`,
      # with a few modifications. `:syntax` should be set appropriately,
      # `:filename` should be set to `uri`,
      # and `:importer` should be set to this importer.
      #
      # @param uri [String] The URI to import.
      # @param options [{Symbol => Object}] Options for the Sass file
      #   containing the `@import` that's currently being resolved.
      #   This is safe for subclasses to modify destructively.
      #   Callers should only pass in a value they don't mind being destructively modified.
      # @return [Sass::Engine, nil] An Engine containing the imported file,
      #   or nil if it couldn't be found or was in the wrong format.
