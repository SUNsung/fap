    # Create url helpers to be used with resource/scope configuration. Acts as
    # proxies to the generated routes created by devise.
    # Resource param can be a string or symbol, a class, or an instance object.
    # Example using a :user resource:
    #
    #   new_session_path(:user)      => new_user_session_path
    #   session_path(:user)          => user_session_path
    #   destroy_session_path(:user)  => destroy_user_session_path
    #
    #   new_password_path(:user)     => new_user_password_path
    #   password_path(:user)         => user_password_path
    #   edit_password_path(:user)    => edit_user_password_path
    #
    #   new_confirmation_path(:user) => new_user_confirmation_path
    #   confirmation_path(:user)     => user_confirmation_path
    #
    # Those helpers are included by default to ActionController::Base.
    #
    # In case you want to add such helpers to another class, you can do
    # that as long as this new class includes both url_helpers and
    # mounted_helpers. Example:
    #
    #     include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
    #     include Rails.application.routes.mounted_helpers
    #
