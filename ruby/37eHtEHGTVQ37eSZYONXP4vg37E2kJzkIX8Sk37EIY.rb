    # Description:: Content Security Policy, a mechanism web applications
    #               can use to mitigate a broad class of content injection
    #               vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
    #               Content Security Policy is a declarative policy that lets
    #               the authors (or server administrators) of a web application
    #               inform the client about the sources from which the
    #               application expects to load resources.
